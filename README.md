1. More Data, More Dynamics
Place additional labels (total three for each axis) in the scatter plot and give them click events so that users can decide which data to display. Animate the transitions for the circles' locations as well as the range of the axes.

2. Incorporate d3-tip
Using the d3-tip.js plugin developed by Justin Palmer, add tooltips to the circles and display each tooltip with the data that the user has selected.
